A PTY is just a byte stream and does not synthesize replies, so without a client acting as a terminal emulator, the queries go unanswered. This breaks the intended architecture where clients are optional passive viewers and the coordinator is the primary VT engine.\n\nPlanned solution: Have the coordinator/VT engine treat DSR/CPR as a terminal-emulator responsibility. Detect CPR/DSR escape sequences in the output processing path and synthesize replies using the real cursor state from the VT engine (1-indexed row/col). Write the reply back into the PTY input stream for that session. This should happen regardless of attached clients so headless mode is fully functional.
